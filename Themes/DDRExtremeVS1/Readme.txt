Numbers:
Resized one, fixed my old Combo numbers (based on SM original ones) to be more accure and relinked a couple of them.

Images:
Some few taken from DDRMAX2 Delta2 (new ones, not available on DDRMAX2 Delta1 Tester Release),
other were created by me using different graphic mixes, unlock icons were totally new,
ranking bullets were totally redone and most of remaining ones were resized to fit arcade sizes.

What's new with this release:
For first time you'll see BGAnimation mixed with metrics, helping to do posible some impossible displays.
To check it easy, watch: Options Screen, Select Difficulty -Select Master-, and so...

About this Metric-BGAnimation combination:
Some screens or images could not be exactly on its corresponding place (cause of my computer. You'll check
some pixel failures), but i did try to draw it the best possible as i can. Better graphics are impossible
to me for the momment.

Basically i took Tamago's skin and redone it.
Only arcade images could help to reach more arcade perfection.
