DM Ashura is most certainly an interesting person - we used to be friends, but nowadays, I just can't stand his attitude... but I don't blame how he probably can't stand mine, either. Oh well, it's all good. This will be the only DM Ashura simfile I will ever do. As for why I did this simfile - well, I did it because I was hoping it would get a lot of downloads - I mean, a lot of people have the same common goal, right? But as time progressed, I realized it's about what you like to do in the end - and what I like to do is to make simfiles for real music and to stray away from the techno/trance stuff with piano beats in it which you honestly can't even listen in the car. Sometimes I don't want to make the simfiles too difficult, but then again, some people want it to be oh-so-super hard! Oh well. I mean, haven't they heard of carpal tunnel? It's like some horrible disease for the hands. I don't want to make a simfile product that makes peoples' hands latently disabled - that's really, really bad. Oh well, it's all in the world of Stepmania.

Don't know who will read this - but thanks for your time!
