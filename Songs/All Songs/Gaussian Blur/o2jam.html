This is like a uber O2Jam. Remember Malaysian O2Jam and how it went p2p? At first, it sucked. But it's better than the Korean version now, believe it or not. Carly, Toph, Kil, and myself are all signed up for this game, as well as a good amount of a0.com users.
<br><br>
I got this game today, and I am just blown away. The Thai version has NOTHING on this. The amount of items, areas, songs, content.. everything is just amazingly done well. There's WAY more items than they used to have, and thankfully, none of them are short shorts.
<br><br>
<b>If you had a Malaysian O2Jam account in the past, all your stuff is still there.</b>
<br><br>
The amount of songs compared to the Thai version is ridiculous. There's about 60 songs on the regular o2jam. There's over 150 (I didn't bother to count them - I know it's over 200 if you include p2p songs) songs in the game, and so many of them are great.
<br><br>
To the better players - remember how in O2jam Thai, the hardest song is Blade? Well, in this game they have at least two pages of songs harder than blade. It's ridiculous. Speaking of hard songs, "Gaussian Blur" by Kil  and "Sever the System" by Toph/HoisinSauce, as well as "Tell Me A Story" are all set for O2Jam. Oh yeah, Up 'N Down is in here too, so you can finally say "Nice Up 'N Down" to your hearts content.

If you've played any p2p game, you're concerned about the price, because games like World of Warcraft can add up quickly. World of Warcraft is $15.00 a month, O2Jam NX is <b>$2.50 for a month</b>. Seriously, when you're thinking about the price of this, think about how much you spend at an arcade compared to a game like o2jam. The songs are about $0.75 a song, I will outline the p2p songs I got (I got 1000 points for 27 dollars, I bought somewhere between 15 to 20 songs and have about 400 points left over, so I will outline the ones I bought)
<br><br>
Comparing O2Jam Thai to O2Jam NX is like comparing Beatmania 5 key to Beatmania IIDX RED or Beatmania IIDX 8th Style, or DDR 1st Mix to DDR Extreme
<br><br>
I've permanently uninstalled my thai folder. I have official word that the Thai version is always going to be pretty much 4 months behind the Malaysian O2Jam even when the Thai version upgrades to NX. I will set up an easy mirror for the download of the malaysian version, in a bit, but right now you have to settle for downloading off the O2Jam official malaysia site. Kil, Toph, Carly/citrus and myself are all switching to O2Jam NX, probably Reach too in March when his keyboard gets fixed.
