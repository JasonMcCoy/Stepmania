"Kick Your A" is an industrialized remix of A by SuperGreenX, who some of you may already know for his remix of B4U, entitled "4F73R M3". When he originally "brought this down", many people wanted a DWI of it immediately, but the cut was being saved for this particular DWI, because the original remix was over 4 minutes long. Mwerp and Radical J did a DWI of the long version, but that didn't get much circulation, and it wasn't practical enough for your average keyboarder (since it was a keyboard DWI).

The background is by Reach. The amount of work that went into making this background, the nitpicking, the waiting, everything, is a masterpiece in itself. Some people consider backgrounds as a meaningless tiara for the princess that is the steps, but it's more than that. The background expresses the emotion of the song, the feel of the song. A background like this is incredibly hard to make, because the song is so emotional, and doesn't have a certain vibe for the entire song. Reach has already been known for his amazing graphics for backgrounds in his and other people's stepfiles, and this is certainly no different. It uses a few quotes from the Goli background, like the "what is true strength", and it uses the jester.

The heavy steps are sort of a tribute to BMR. They are designed a lot like his original A, but with some tweaks in their rhythms and patterns and stuff. It's not the same, it doesn't feel like you're playing a paste of the old song. The end might, but they're not the exact same steps either. I did use some things mirrored for the piano I admit, but that's because no other pattern worked for it.

The challenge steps are sort of like a tweak of the heavy steps, or an [Another] version. They go to basically every significant sound in the music, to some extent. If you think the challenge steps are totally nonsensical with how I placed the notes (not the step patterns - that's purely opinion), put all the sound into one speaker by editing the mp3, and then slow it down and listen harder. If you still think the steps are nonsensical and go to nonexisting sounds, then you are pretty musically illiterate, sorry.

The standard (pad heavy), I tried to keep the Konami steps in mind when making it. I didn't want to make the slow part boring, so I put a lot of stuff where you have to double step, that or be a god of weird spins/turns. It's kind of karaoke in some parts, but I tried to keep a balance between karaoke and not, because if the steps don't seem like they're going to the music at all they seem kind of dull, despite how "creative" they are or whatever. People said these standard steps were boring, but then again those same people also thought that TM5 "Punk" song was a GRRREEEAAAAT song to DWI and loved its pad steps.

The basic (pad standard) reminds me of MAX300 standard. I don't know why, but it does. I wasn't even keeping MAX300 standard in mind when I made it. I dunno how to elaborate on these, but I could do some fun stuff I couldn't do in the heavy because it would make it too easy.

The beginner (pad light) was a quickie, but I think it turned out good. I tried to keep a balance where it's hard enough to be a decent challenge for beginners (5 feet), but still able to freestyle on (incase someone ever puts this on a SM machine or whatever). 

As for the songs syncing.. it varies. Don't whine because it's offsync, it's impossible to be onsync on every single person's computer. Instead, if it is offsync for you, use some method of resyncing it, like little mode + auto adjust on Stepmania. For me, it's perfectly onsync.
