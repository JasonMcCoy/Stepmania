This is my readme for my dwi thinger for the lord or the finger thinger

cool init?

Just want to say hi i guess. lol. arch wanted a readme so here it is

Challenge is a strong 11 footer. Its the exact same difficulty 4 fingered and 2 fingered, as I've AAA'd it both ways. Plays well 1 handed aswell. Goes to all the sounds in the music, and the guitar and subtle clear piano notes between.

Heavy is a much lighter stepfile. Its pad possible at 10 feet...But the steps are ment for a keyboard. It goes to more of the main melody in most parts, and then more of the base sounds instead of the guitar in others.

Thought this one was pretty fun, hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do. <3
